IT Help Desk Support work is very tedious and it generally involves looking over the same issue again and again and spending too much time on going through the manual docs and finding the exact resolution.
Sometimes there are very basic queries like password reset , account set up etc. and even for this , users have to raise a ticket and wait for the ticket resolution . The whole process is very time consuming and most of the agent time is spend in solving the same query.
Productivity is decreased and Companyâ€™s resources are underutilized.
Our project tackles this problem with a Machine Learning approach using python.
